# Topics of Ada presented of this Project:
##  1. In & Out Parameters:
In Ada, subprograms (procedures and functions) use explicit parameter modes to define how data is passed and used within a call. These modes are: in, out, and in out. This design choice is central to Ada's philosophy of safety, clarity, and correctness.

### in Parameters
These are read-only parameters. The caller provides a value, and the callee may use it but cannot modify it.

```ada
procedure Display(Value : in Integer);
```

Attempting to write to Value in the procedure body would result in a compile-time error.

### out Parameters
These are write-only from the perspective of the callee. The caller does not expect any initial value, and the callee must assign a value before returning.

```ada
procedure Compute(Result : out Integer);
```

Reading from Result before assigning a value is a compile-time error.

### in out Parameters
These are read-write. The caller passes a value that the callee can both read and modify.

```ada
procedure Update(Counter : in out Integer);
```

This is suitable when the subprogram needs to modify and return a new version of a variable.

### Example:
A full example demonstrating all three parameter modes (in, out, and in out) can be found in:

```bash
src/focus_points/inandoutexample.adb
```

This example defines a procedure that takes:
- an in parameter: a number that will be doubled,
- an in out parameter: a counter that tracks how many times the procedure has been called,
- an out parameter: a message string that describes the result of the operation.

When the procedure is called:
- The input number is read but not modified (ensured by in mode).
- The counter is incremented and retained across calls (thanks to in out mode).
- The message is assigned a new string and returned to the caller (out mode).

This example illustrates the clear separation of roles for each parameter â€” a principle that helps prevent unintended side effects and improves code readability and correctness.

### Comparasion with Java:
In Java, there is no way to explicitly declare if a parameter is used for input, output, or both.
All parameters are passed by value â€” but if you pass an object, Java copies the reference, so you can change the objectâ€™s content.

UNSURE: maybe at least the type of out is defined via void/int/etc.?

```java
class Data {
    public int value;
}

void update(Data d) {
    d.value = 42; // modifies the original object
}
```

This works because d refers to the same object.

But if you try the same with a primitive type like int:
```java
void update(int x) {
    x = 42;
}
```

Nothing changes outside the function â€” x is just a copy.

In summary:
- Java lets you modify objects, but not primitives.
- Thereâ€™s no compiler check to ensure how parameters are used.
- In contrast, Ada forces you to be explicit (in, out, in out) â€” making data flow clear, safe, and verifiable.

##  2. In & Out Parameters:
In Ada, tasks are units of concurrent execution. The rendezvous mechanism allows tasks to communicate and synchronize by exchanging control and data in a safe and predictable way.

A rendezvous occurs when:
- A calling task invokes an entry of another task.
- The receiving task executes an accept statement for that entry.
- Both tasks wait for each other: the call and accept must happen at the same time.
- Once matched, the accept block executes and the tasks proceed.

This mechanism enforces safe synchronization between tasks, avoiding race conditions and ensuring clear communication patterns.

Core Features of Rendezvous
- Mutual Exclusion: only one task at a time can perform a rendezvous for a specific entry.
- Synchronization: both caller and callee block until they are both ready.
- Data Exchange: parameters can be passed to and from the entry during the rendezvous.
- Controlled Selection: with select, a task can choose between multiple possible rendezvous, handle timeouts, or terminate gracefully.

### Example:
A complete example of a server task interacting with two client tasks using rendezvous is provided in:

```bash
src/focus_points/inandoutexample.adb
```

This example defines:
- A Server task with an entry Print_Message.
- Two concurrent tasks (Client_1 and Client_2) that call Print_Message at different times.
- A select block in the Server that handles:
  - Incoming messages via accept
  - A timeout using delay

The rendezvous happens at each call to Print_Message, where the client task is blocked until the server accepts the message. Once both are ready, the server prints the message and both tasks continue.

### Visual Explanation:
This sequence diagram shows how Client_1 and Client_2 interact with the Server task, when the rendezvous occurs, and how the Server exits after inactivity.

### Comparison with Java:
In Java, communication and synchronization between threads is typically done using:
- synchronized methods or blocks,
- shared variables with manual locking (ReentrantLock, volatile),
- low-level primitives like wait() and notify().

While powerful, these mechanisms are error-prone and require the programmer to manually ensure synchronization and mutual exclusion.

In contrast, Ada provides a built-in, safer mechanism: the rendezvous.

A rendezvous in Ada:
- synchronizes the caller and the callee automatically,
- ensures mutual exclusion (only one task at a time is accepted),
- allows structured data exchange via entry parameters,
- makes concurrency explicit and verifiable by the compiler.

#### Ada (safe, explicit rendezvous):

```ada
-- Client task
Server.Print_Message("Hello!");

-- Server task
accept Print_Message(Msg : String) do
    Put_Line(Msg);
end;
```

#### Java (manual synchronization, less safe):

```java
class Server {
    public synchronized void printMessage(String msg) {
        System.out.println(msg);
    }
}

// In a thread
server.printMessage("Hello");
```

In Java:
- synchronized ensures mutual exclusion inside the method,
- but does not synchronize the client and server â€” the caller continues immediately,
- thereâ€™s no rendezvous, just a protected method.

To achieve similar synchronization, Java would require more complex constructs using wait() and notify(), which are harder to reason about and easier to misuse.

In summary:
- Ada forces you to structure concurrent communication safely and clearly.
- Java gives you flexibility, but puts the burden of correctness on the programmer.

## Protected Objects and Types
In Ada, protected objects are used to manage shared data between multiple tasks safely and efficiently. They are similar to monitors or synchronized objects in other languages, but are built into the language and enforced by the compiler.

Protected objects combine:
- Mutual exclusion: Only one task can execute a protected operation at a time.
- Data encapsulation: State is stored inside the object and cannot be accessed directly.
- Optional synchronization: Using entry and when conditions.

### Protected Types vs Protected Objects
- A protected type defines the interface and internal data (like a class).
- A protected object is an instance of a protected type (like an object).

### Example:
A complete example of a protected type with its object is provided in:

```bash
src/focus_points/protectedobjectstypes.adb
```

This program defines a Safe_Counter protected type with:
- a procedure Increment to increase the internal counter,
- a function Get to retrieve the current value.

Two tasks (Worker_1 and Worker_2) increment the counter concurrently. The protected object ensures that access to the counter is safe and mutually exclusive.

Even though two tasks operate in parallel, the counter is incremented correctly, without data races.

### Comparison with Java:
In Java, managing shared data between threads typically involves using:
- synchronized methods or blocks,
- explicit locks (ReentrantLock),
- or low-level primitives like wait() and notify().

To simplify concurrent access to numeric variables, Java also provides atomic classes such as AtomicInteger and AtomicBoolean, which allow safe updates without locks â€” but only for very specific use cases.

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized int get() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

This ensures mutual exclusion, but puts the responsibility for correctness on the programmer. Thereâ€™s no compiler help for complex coordination.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

counter.incrementAndGet();  // atomic increment
int value = counter.get();  // safe read
```

This is more efficient than synchronized, but only supports simple operations. You cannot define complex, condition-based logic like in Adaâ€™s entry ... when.

In contrast, Ada provides protected objects:
- Defined explicitly via protected type,
- Enforced by the compiler,
- Support atomic procedures, safe functions, and conditional entries.

# Fazit:
## Davide Ceresa
Working with Ada has been a formative experience. At first, I struggled with its strict syntax and formality, especially compared to more permissive languages like Java or Python. Even working with basic structures such as strings was not always intuitive â€” I often had to use Unbounded_String to make things simpler and more flexible.

One of the most rewarding aspects of Ada was its built-in approach to concurrency. Once I understood the task model, the rendezvous mechanism, and protected objects, I realized how powerful and well-integrated these features are. Compared to Java, where concurrency often requires additional libraries and boilerplate code, Ada provides a clear, structured model for concurrent programming directly out of the box.

That said, the learning curve was real. Ada is not widely used today, and finding resources, examples, or community support was sometimes difficult. Documentation is available, but not always easy to digest without prior exposure to the languageâ€™s mindset.

In the end, although I donâ€™t think I will use Ada again in future personal or professional projects, I understand why it is used in safety-critical domains. Its language design enforces correctness, and its concurrency model encourages writing reliable and predictable code. For applications where failure is not an option, Adaâ€™s philosophy makes perfect sense.
