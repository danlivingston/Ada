# Ada

## Introduction:
TODO

## Installing Alire:

This project uses [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev), the Ada package manager, to manage dependencies, compilation, and execution.

To get started, follow the official installation instructions here:  
ðŸ‘‰ https://alire.ada.dev/docs/#getting-started

You can then verify the installation executing the following command:
```bash
    alr --version
```
If you see the version number, you are good to go!

## Using this repo:
After installing Alire, you can use this project by cloning this repo
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/danlivingston/Ada.git
```

After cloning this repository, run the following commands:

```bash
    cd Ada        # Enter the project folder    Â§
    alr build     # Builds the project and downloads dependencies
    alr run       # Runs the executable
```

# Topics of Ada presented of this Project:
##  1. In & Out Parameters:
In Ada, subprograms (procedures and functions) use explicit parameter modes to define how data is passed and used within a call. These modes are: in, out, and in out. This design choice is central to Ada's philosophy of safety, clarity, and correctness.

### in Parameters
These are read-only parameters. The caller provides a value, and the callee may use it but cannot modify it.

```bash
procedure Display(Value : in Integer);
```

Attempting to write to Value in the procedure body would result in a compile-time error.

### out Parameters
These are write-only from the perspective of the callee. The caller does not expect any initial value, and the callee must assign a value before returning.

```bash
procedure Compute(Result : out Integer);
```

Reading from Result before assigning a value is a compile-time error.

### in out Parameters
These are read-write. The caller passes a value that the callee can both read and modify.

```bash
procedure Update(Counter : in out Integer);
```

This is suitable when the subprogram needs to modify and return a new version of a variable.

## Example:
A full example demonstrating all three parameter modes (in, out, and in out) can be found in:

```bash
    src/theory/inandoutexample.adb
```

This example defines a procedure that takes:
- an in parameter: a number that will be doubled,
- an in out parameter: a counter that tracks how many times the procedure has been called,
- an out parameter: a message string that describes the result of the operation.

When the procedure is called:
- The input number is read but not modified (ensured by in mode).
- The counter is incremented and retained across calls (thanks to in out mode).
- The message is assigned a new string and returned to the caller (out mode).

This example illustrates the clear separation of roles for each parameter â€” a principle that helps prevent unintended side effects and improves code readability and correctness.

## Comparasion with Java:
In Java, there is no way to explicitly declare if a parameter is used for input, output, or both.
All parameters are passed by value â€” but if you pass an object, Java copies the reference, so you can change the objectâ€™s content.

```java
    class Data {
        public int value;
    }

    void update(Data d) {
        d.value = 42; // modifies the original object
    }
```

This works because d refers to the same object.

But if you try the same with a primitive type like int:
```java
    void update(int x) {
        x = 42;
    }
```

Nothing changes outside the function â€” x is just a copy.

In summary:
- Java lets you modify objects, but not primitives.
- Thereâ€™s no compiler check to ensure how parameters are used.
- In contrast, Ada forces you to be explicit (in, out, in out) â€” making data flow clear, safe, and verifiable.
